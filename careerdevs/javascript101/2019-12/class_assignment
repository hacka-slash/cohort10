In carrental.js, add 'populate the array', add to the empty array the car that we rented.

After that, create a program with arrays of your own and make use of the array functions such as"
    .push(),
    .pop(),
    .unshift(),
    .shift(),
    .splice(),

    ..Any questions, ask me, and we'll go over it
